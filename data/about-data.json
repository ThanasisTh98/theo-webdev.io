      "I'm a web developer based just north of London, with a genuine love for front-end development and all things design. I started out in electronics and robotics working as a Techncian before moving into web development, and that hands-on technical background still shapes how I build today — with a mix of creativity, precision, and problem-solving.",
      "Right now, I'm expanding my skill set by diving into TypeScript and React, adding more depth and flexibility to my projects and portfolio. I really enjoy bringing designs to life in the browser, crafting clean, accessible, and visually engaging experiences that just feel good to use.",
      "When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me at the gym, clearing my head and chasing new goals — same mindset I bring to development, really: steady progress and constant improvement."
